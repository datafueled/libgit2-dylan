This library wraps `libgit2`_.

Be sure to clone this recursively::

    git clone --recursive <url for repo>

To do a build, use ``make`` so that the appropriate steps
are executed.

You will need Open Dylan 2012.1 or later.

You will also need a build of ``melange`` from the
`melange`_ repo on your ``$PATH``.
